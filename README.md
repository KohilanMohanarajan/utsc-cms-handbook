## Working on the Handbook

The handbook is written in LaTeX, if you want a refresher, there's tons of resources online to learn LaTeX from, there's also this guide I made a while back: https://kohilanm.com/csca67/helpdocuments/beginners-guide-csca67.pdf

You can either work offline with something like TeXMaker w/ MikTeX, or work online, with tools like ShareLaTeX or Overleaf.  Just be sure to update "main.tex" with whatever new material you add.
